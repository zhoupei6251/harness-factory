# Billing, errors, and recovery

Every generation tool consumes Beatra credits and creates an asynchronous task.
Use one logical request identity across transport uncertainty so recovery cannot
accidentally create or charge a duplicate task.

## Submit a billable request

1. Assemble the final generation arguments.
2. Generate one opaque `client_request_id`.
3. Submit exactly once.
4. Store both `client_request_id` and the returned `task_id`.
5. Poll with `beatra.tasks.get`; do not resubmit while the task is queued or
   running.

The prepaid amount accepted with the request can be an estimate. A successful
task is settled against authoritative measured usage. Read the terminal
`usage` and `billing` fields, and report net credits as
`billing.net_charged_credits`. Do not promise that the initial estimate
is the final charge.

## Recover an uncertain response

- If no response arrived, make an identical retry with the same
  `client_request_id` and exactly the same generation arguments.
- If any prompt, input artifact, model, output setting, or other generation
  argument changes, treat it as new work and use a new `client_request_id`.
- If the task ID was lost, use `beatra.tasks.list` before considering a retry.
- If remote execution failed, report the terminal error. Start changed or newly
  requested work only with a new request ID.

## Handle structured failures

- HTTP 401 authentication failure: do not replay the paid call automatically.
  Run `python3 scripts/authorize.py` and follow its output
  until it prints `Beatra is ready`, then recover with the original request
  identity and unchanged arguments.
- Timeout, DNS/TLS, HTTP 429, HTTP 5xx, or another transport failure: preserve
  the credential. If delivery of a paid call is uncertain, retry only with the
  same `client_request_id` and exactly the same arguments after connectivity
  recovers.
- Insufficient scope: explain that the active connection lacks required access;
  run `python3 scripts/authorize.py --force` only after the
  user explicitly chooses to reconnect the full Beatra authorization. Never ask
  for a media-specific grant.
- Insufficient balance (error code `insufficient_balance`): relay the returned
  message to the user — it already carries the facts that matter: nothing was
  charged, the top-up link, credits take effect immediately, and the same
  request can be retried as-is. Translate into the user's language but keep
  the URL exactly as returned. Do not retry until the user says they have
  topped up. A successful task can also leave a negative balance when actual
  measured usage exceeded the estimate; the output remains valid, but new
  billable work must wait for a top-up.
- Idempotency conflict: the request identity was reused with different
  arguments. Do not retry it. Keep the original task if it exists, or use a new
  `client_request_id` only for user-approved changed work.
- Rate or concurrency limit: honor the returned retry delay, then retry the
  exact same arguments with the same request identity. Do not create a
  replacement task.
- Validation failure or model incompatibility: call `beatra.models.list` for current
  constraints, correct the invalid arguments, and use a new
  `client_request_id` because the generation inputs changed.
- Upload expiration, MIME mismatch, or byte-length mismatch: request a fresh
  grant and upload the unchanged file again. Never reuse a consumed or expired
  grant.
- Remote execution failure: preserve the Beatra error code and task ID;
  report only the failure classification and billing/refund fields returned by
  Beatra. Do not infer a different cause or promise a refund that is not shown.

Never expose authentication tokens, complete private prompts, or sensitive
input content while explaining recovery.
