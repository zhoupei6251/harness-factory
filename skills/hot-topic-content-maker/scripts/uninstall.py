"""Uninstall one Beatra Skill package without stranding the shared connection.

The device connection (~/.beatra) is shared by every installed Beatra skill.
Removing one skill must therefore never touch the shared credential while any
other skill still uses it — even when the user asks for a complete removal.
Only when this device's skill inventory says nothing else is left does the
credential revoke itself and the local state leave with it.

Every uncertain situation resolves to "keep the connection": a wrongly kept
credential idles out server-side after 15 days and can be revoked from the
Console at any time, while a wrongly revoked one breaks every remaining skill.

This script never deletes the package directory it runs from — it reports the
directory so the calling agent can remove it as the final step.
